      (A) Fractional changes in daily precipitation over all regions (P), over the ocean (Po) and surface saturation specific humidity (qs*) as a function of precipitation percentile. P, Po, and qs* are sorted for each day and then averaged over each month from April to September. The changes are computed between 2070 and 1850 and are normalized by the mean surface temperature increase. The solid lines show the mean values of all months across four ensemble members. Shadings show the interquartile range. (B). Mean Iorg in 1850 versus 2070. The error bars show SEs from monthly variations. (C and D) Changes in daily precipitation extremes over all regions [ΔPn, (C)] and daily precipitation extremes over the ocean [ΔPo,n, (D)] versus changes in organization (ΔIorg). The changes are computed between 2070 and 1850 and are normalized by the mean surface temperature increase. Each dot represents the daily change averaged in 1 month, and colors from red to dark red indicate results for daily precipitation extremes at 95th, 99th, and 99.9th percentiles, respectively. Pentagrams are the mean values of all months. The horizontal dashed line in (C) and (D) is the corresponding changes in surface saturation specific humidity (Δqs*). The results are obtained from ICONA.

(Bao et al. 2024 Sci. Adv.)</a></strong></p>
    <p>
      Tropical precipitation extremes are projected to intensify in a warmer climate, but it is unclear what processes can regulate precipitation extremes. With a new generation of models (global storm-resolving model), ones that explicitly represent the transient dynamics of convective storms, this study highlights the importance of spatial clustering of convection at mesoscale, a process that is not resolved by conventional global climate models, to influence how precipitation extremes will change with warming. When convective storms are more clustered, tropical precipitation extremes increase with storms being less numerous but larger in size. Furthermore, the results indicate that potential possibility of strong intensification of the heaviest rainfall as climate warms is related to this mesoscale process.

    <p>
      We analyse ERA5 reanalysis data and discover that there exist substantial zonal temperature gradients in the tropical free troposphere. This contradicts the conventional understanding that the tropical free-tropospheric temperature is spatially uniform with weak temperature gradients.

(Bao et al. 2021 J. Meteo. Soc. Japan)</a></strong></p>
    <p>
      By combining theoretical understanding of tropical thermal structure with data analysis using observations and global storm-resolving models (GSRMs), We find that the tropical atmosphere in saturated convective regions tends to adopt a thermal structure that is isentropic below the zero-degree isotherm and pseudo-adiabatic above it. However, the tropical mean temperature is substantially colder and is set by the bulk of convection, which is affected by entrainment in the lower troposphere.
