Tropical temperature and lapse rates

  <figcaption> Spatial anomalies of the climatological monthly mean Tv500 (K; shading) and T500 (K; contours) averaged in (a) January and (b) July. The spatial anomalies are computed by subtracting the spatial mean values over 20°N–20°S for January and July.</figcaption>

  <p style="max-width: 600px;">I used reanalysis data and discovered that there exists substantial zonal temperature gradients in the tropical free troposphere. This contradicts the conventional understanding that the tropical free-tropospheric temperature is spatially uniform with weak temperature gradients. .</p>
