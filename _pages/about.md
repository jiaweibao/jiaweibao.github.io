I am a postdoc at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany. My broad research interest is tropical convection and dynamics. I use a range of tools including theory, modeling and observations to study convection and how they interact with large-scale circulation. I completed my Ph.D in Climate Science at the University of New South Walse in Sydney Australia. My Ph.D research was about understanding extreme precipitation and its links with convective organisation.
