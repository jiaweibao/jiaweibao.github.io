I am a postdoc at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany. My broad research interest is tropical convection and dynamics. I use a range of tools including theory, modeling and observations to study convection and how they interact with large-scale circulation. I completed my Ph.D in Climate Science at the University of New South Walse in Sydney Australia. My Ph.D research was about understanding extreme precipitation and its links with convective organisation.

1. **Organization of convection**
- In idealized simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium, the organization of deep convection has been found to be very important for not only the local weather and climate, but also the large-scale environment. However, its influence in a realistic context is still not clear. I am using observations and global storm-resolving model simulations to study it.

2. **Tropical precipitation extremes**
- Tropical precipitation extremes tend to increase with rising temperatures. However, there are large uncertainties in terms of the rate of increase. Our current understanding of future precipitation extremes are mainly based on coarse-resolution global climate models (GCMs). One major criticism of such models is that the convective processes are parameterized, making it less appropriate for studying tropical precipitation extremes. I am trying to use global storm-resolving model (GSRM) simulations to see whether GSRMs can further improve our understanding.

3. **Tropical thermodynamics**

Observations and models show different rates of warming in the upper troposphere over the tropics. To understand why they differ, we need to understand the fundamental questions: what determines the thermal structure of the tropical atmosphere? 
- Are the tropical lapse rates moist-adiabatic? 
- How homogeneous are the temperatures horizontally?
